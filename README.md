# A Zombie Apocalypse Game in Java 

Main driver code is in ```src/game``` folder

I contributed in coding the game logic and design which can be found in ```design-docs``` 

```doc``` contains all the java doc of each classes and methods

# Reflection after the Project (Updated Sep 2023) 

1. Some inheritance and enumerable could have been better as an interface and implement certain capabilities (interface)
2. There are certain hint of downcasting which did suggest there may be a better design implementation which completely eliminates downcasting
3. Though most parts are extensible, however with the lack of capabilities interfaces, there are still some rigid areas.
